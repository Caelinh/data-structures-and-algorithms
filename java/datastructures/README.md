## Implementation Notes

## Challenge
Create a node class and linked list class that is able to add a node, display to string and check if a node is included.  

## Approach & Efficiency
For this approach it was pretty straightforward as it was the initial implementation. The difficult part was figuring out how to iterate through the list as well as converting the values to a string.  I believe the efficiency is a O(n)

## API
Insert- Adds a value to the list  
Includes- checks to see if a value exists  
to string- convert the linked list to a string.
